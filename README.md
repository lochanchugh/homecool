Homeschooling made easy through NIOS.

## How will we solve the problem.

To solve a problem we need to determine the problem first. When taking about Homeschooling there are a few problems which comes to mind:
- Difficulty in finding right information quickly.
- Undetermined Admission process.
- Unstructered user/student data.
- Scattered course structure and learning Resources.
- Disrupted Notification system.
- Old and Boaring website designs.

We are planning to work towards fixing all of the above mentioned problems by creating a playful and simple Web App. This
Web app will be strcutured in a modern way so that students can easily navigate through the app and find whatever they are looking for! The best application is the one where users feel comfortable navigating and working on, thus we will work on building such a thing.

> We might even build apps for Android and IOS to make our solution even more accessible and useful to a wide variety of audience.

## Our Final Demo.

We want everyone to be at ease and thus will build 2 applications:

### Main Web App.
- We will make admission process a lot easier by developing a modern registration system.
- Student dashboard where students can manage everything related to their profile.
  - Precise Course details.
  - Study material based on their current course.
  - Detailed admission cycle and other details.
- A better and improved notification system.

### Admin Web App.
- Approve/disapprove addmission forms.
- Generate roll number as soon as the form is approved.
- A special mailing system for admin to contact each registered student without using a mailbox.
- View the details of all the students semester and year wise.
- Option to add the study material for a particular course and semester.

> Even more features can be added along the way.
