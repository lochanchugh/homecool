## Theme name.
Homeschooling made easy through NIOS.

## How will we solve the problem.
We'll be simplifying the site by gamifying, prioritizing, and making it easy to access the resources. The modern design would be found much more quick and easy with access to a wider range of resources. We may even build apps for it as it's even more convenient.


## Our Final Demo.
There would be elegant registration system, student dashboard with precise course details, study resources, detailed admission cycle and improved notification system. Admin portal would have control over forms, auto generation of roll numbers, notifications and study resources.
